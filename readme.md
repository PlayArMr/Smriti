This is a dead project, inactive, and archived. Moderation features are implemented, in mod.py(contains profanity for checking reasons). Geeta api calling problems could not be fixed, so !geeta dosent work. commands that do work: !hello (greets user) !radiance (test command, sends a message about a verse of the geeta) !shutdown <4 string key> (shutdown command, a unique security key generated by a class, which is known only by admins and sent to them on dm's) !testprofanity (profanity testing, if a word is considered 'profanity')
